In working on issue #83 "Added code to display informational toolttips in new task window." I found thatt ttthere was previously
saved labels and code to be implemented later thatt would show tthe proper tooltip per box on the New Task GUI.

I used the following branches to alter tthe project and push it to the main branch for a pull requestt. 
* 951d602 original changes to implement info tooltip buttons.
* f4eeed2, 825c319 fixing white spaces for the checkstylemain issue.
