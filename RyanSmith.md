In working on issue #83 "Added code to display informational toolttips in new task window." I found that there was previously
saved labels and code to be implemented later thatt would show the proper tooltip per box on the New Task GUI.(info new task.png)

I used the following branches to alter the project and push it to the main branch for a pull request. 
* 951d602 original changes to implement info tooltip buttons.
* f4eeed2, 825c319 fixing white spaces for the checkstylemain issue.
* 63ca116 verify that my code was working properly and all checkstyle issues were resolve.

I had to re-pull myt project and submit a new pull request. This request implemented my first change later from the first submission 
as well as the corrected code and correct submission with my change.

* 951d602 First change with my first idea to activatee the tool tips
* d248be0 Last commit after re pulling repository and deleting my accidental adition of the .dat file. (icon fix.png)
