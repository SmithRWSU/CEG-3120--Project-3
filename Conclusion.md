The original goal of this issue was to add a "complete" button to the new requirements function, to allow the user to change the completed
status of the requirements. By changing the completed satus you could then complete task or activities that used requiremend for their
dependencies. I had to change my projectt however after realising that by activating the tthe activities, requirements, and the new task in the
proper order you could already complete each with no needed changes to the code. Because of this I changed my issue to activatting the 
information icons that are present in each of these new activity GUI enviroments. By changing the code to acttivate tthese information bubbles
The already created label will be shown when the icon is clicked giving tthe user information over each part of the anew task GUI and 
what informattion needs to be input into the corosponding box.

While working on this new issue I was able to find where tthe tool tips were previously writtten but not implemented intto tthe code. I was able
to add code that would show a ttextt box when tthe user clicks on the informattional tool tip icon. This isnt however the proper label and instead the 
new task dialouge box which appears when you click the "+" sign to add a new task not previously stated. I was unable to find the proper way tto formatt
my code to get the proper dialouge box by the deadline of the project.
